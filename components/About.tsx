College of Engineering and Management (Nagpur) which is affiliated with Dr.Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, with a passion for developing scalable web-applications and focused on full stack development.
<br/> <br/>
I started my development journey as a hobby in technology, and to understand the foundation of computers, I chose Computer Science and Engineering and this is where I got introduced to the amazing field of Web-Developments. The shift in my career happened when I started self-learning the new developing techniques and tools which made me learn more about technology.<br/><br/>
I am an enthusiastic and motivated team player with great imagination and excellent organizational skills. I enjoy taking on challenging tasks that encourage me to think and create outside the box and contribute to my personalÂ growth.
